David,
Thanks for making Pillbox API possible. Good to have a publicly available version of pill identifier data seen on commercial websites like drugs.com.

I know years of development have gone into the API. Would suggest:
- adding RXSTRING as an input
- adding generic name of drug

Would like to know how I could download all the XML records and store it in a SQL database. Does this mean setting the lower limit to the maximum number possible? For my prototype, I'd like to be able to search by pill name first. Later I will add in options to search by shape, color, ingredients, etc. And it might allow for some cool D3 visualizations see example: http://adelaidechen.com/drug.html

From meeting with a Code for America Fellow (at headquarters in San Francisco) about a collaborative project, the clinical trials database was a main interest of this fellow. I think the Pillbox API data could be used with the clinical trials API. The user looks up the pill and pulls up the clinical trial data. It's an idea that I'm experimenting with. http://clinicaltrials.gov/

The roadblock is that there is no unique identifier (like a code or ID) for a drug that could link the two tables (pill and clinical trial). Unless you know of one? Pillbox seems to use brand names and clinical trials API uses generic names. Can you confirm the brand names assumption I made?

Lastly, I recently created a "URL constructor" using Python in case anyone wants to generate the URL instead of entering it manually:
https://gist.github.com/adelaide01/fa7de434a04dca3d7d1f
The XML results are returned in the terminal.

Thanks!

Adelaide,

Thank you for inquiring about the NLM Pillbox API beta.  We'd be delighted to include you.

Your key is GN48R480GH

API docs are at http://pillbox.nlm.nih.gov/NLM_Pillbox_API_documentation_v2_2011.09.27.pdf.  Updated docs are coming.  Current data is August 2012 and will be updated in the next two weeks.  We'll hopefully be making an announcement about the addition of new images in the next couple of months.  Until then the number of images in Pillbox is limited.

Please keep in mind that the API and Pillbox's data and images are still in beta, though we expect to bring the project out of beta in the near future.

This is the disclaimer that's returned with each call.

Subject: API request key


Hello,
I'm writing to request an API key for Pillbox beta.

It is for a potential project with Code for America's brigade. Code for America fellows are paired with local governments. The brigade are community volunteers. I am a programming student working on a final project. My mockup is attached.

Please feel free to ask questions about how this project will use the Pillbox beta.

Thanks!
